# Go UR - WIP ðŸ”¨

This is a repository for an implementation of the UR RTDE protocol. It is useful for integrating your UR cobots with more complex systems and applications.

## Get started

Pull the image and start the dockerized ur-sim: `scripts/ur-sim.sh`

## Controller

A controller is used to send URScript commands to the cobot.
